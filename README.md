pySPIRAL-TAP, a Python version of SPIRAL-TAP
--------------------------------------------

# Inspiration

Everything comes from the code by [Zachary Harmany](http://drz.ac) (harmany@wisc.edu).

Original source: http://drz.ac/code/spiraltap/. The algorithm is described in this paper:
> Z. T. Harmany, R. F. Marcia, and R. M. Willett, "This is SPIRAL-TAP: Sparse Poisson Intensity Reconstruction ALgorithms – Theory and Practice," IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 21, pp. 1084–1096, Mar. 2012.

1. License: I am unsure about the license of the code
2. Code: still experimental (only alphamethod=0 seems to be working)
